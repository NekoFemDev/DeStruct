// Package arm64lift lifts disassembled ARM64 instructions

// infrastructure could eventually render lifted ARM64 code too (as
// C-like syntax, since the IR itself is expression/statement-oriented
// and not Java-specific at the node level).
//
// Unlike JVM bytecode's stack machine, ARM64 is a register machine: a
// value doesn't get pushed/popped through an implicit stack, it lives in
// a named register (w0, x1, sp, ...) until something overwrites it. The

// register name -> the IR expression currently "in" that register,
// updated as each instruction is lifted - not an expression stack like
// the JVM side uses.

//     currently in Rt via regValue/isParam, not merely by which
//     physical register Rt happens to be - unlike an early version of
//     this check, which matched on the register name alone and could
//     therefore mistake a later, genuine reassignment through that
//     same register for another silent spill, silently dropping it -
//     see below): the standard -O0 prologue pattern of copying each
//     incoming argument register to its own stack slot immediately on
//     entry. Pure bookkeeping with no source-level equivalent - lifted
//     silently (no statement); it just teaches the lifter that this
//     slot means this parameter, so a later "ldr" from the same slot
//     resolves back to it (see liftLdr).
//     -- Anything else is a genuine source-level assignment: either
//     the first store to a fresh slot (a new local variable's own
//     initialization - named deterministically from its stack
//     displacement, "local_<disp>", so independent forks that each
//     discover the same slot fresh - see fork's own doc comment on why
//     the stack map isn't shared across forks - agree on the same
//     name without needing to coordinate) or a later store to an
//     already-named slot (reassigning that local, or even a parameter
//     whose value has since changed via that same slot, e.g. "n = n +
//     1;" spilled back to n's own stack home).
//   - [Rn, #disp] for any other base Rn - a write through an arbitrary
//     pointer (a struct field, an array element via a precomputed
//     address, ...). Rendered as a FieldAccess on whatever expression
//     Rn currently holds, named deterministically from disp alone
//     ("field_<disp>") for the same reason stack locals are - there's
//     no debug info to recover the real field name from, and a
//     consistent synthetic one at least reads the same way at every
//     use site. See liftLdr's own doc comment for the matching read

//     when the read side embeds it into a value that might never
//     itself be used.
//

// liftLdr lifts "ldr Rt, [Rn, #disp]" - a load from memory. Three

//
//   - A stack slot previously spilled by liftStr (Rn == sp): if this

//     (see liftStr), the destination register now holds an IR
//     reference to that same name (not a "load" statement - there's
//     nothing to say at the source level; the value simply flows into
//     the register that will use it next).
//   - A GOT/data slot at a known computed address: Rn is a register
//     addrRegs recorded an address for (see its own doc comment,
//     populated by adrp/adr(+add)) - if the resolver knows a name for
//     whatever's stored at that exact address (built from the
//     binary's .rela.dyn relocations - see
//     ELFParser.ResolveGOT's own doc comment for how, e.g., a
//     dynamically-linked std::cout resolves this way), the destination
//     register holds a reference to that name instead of an anonymous
//     loaded value - the common case being a GOT-loaded pointer to a
//     global object that the very next instruction typically uses as
//     an implicit `this`/first argument to some call (an operator<<
//     onto std::cout, say).
//   - Anything else with a real base register: an arbitrary pointer
//     dereference (a struct field, an array element via a
//     precomputed address, ...) - rendered as a FieldAccess on
//     whatever expression Rn currently holds, named deterministically
//     from disp alone ("field_<disp>") the same way a fresh stack
//     local is, since there's equally no debug info here to recover a
//     real field name from.
//
// Rn's own expression (the pointer being dereferenced) is deliberately
// left unconsumed for the third shape, unlike every other place in
// this file that embeds one expression into a larger one: the
// resulting FieldAccess is only installed into Rt's register slot, NOT
// unconditionally emitted as a statement the way liftStr's own
// assignment always is - if Rt goes on to never actually be read, this
// FieldAccess (and everything embedded in it) simply never appears in
// the output at all, same as any other computed-but-discarded value in
// this lifter's model (see liftAdd's own doc comment). Consuming Rn's
// value here regardless would risk a REAL loss for the one case that
// matters more: if Rn's value happens to be an unconsumed call result
// (e.g. "ldr x1, [x0, #8]" right after "x0 = malloc()"), marking it
// consumed here - based purely on being read, with no guarantee this
// FieldAccess itself ever surfaces anywhere - could suppress
// flushRemaining's own fallback flush of that call entirely, silently
// dropping malloc() from the output altogether. Leaving it unconsumed
// costs at most an occasional redundant-looking standalone flush of a
// call whose result ALSO happens to be embedded in some later,
// genuinely-used FieldAccess - a much safer trade than the reverse.
//
// A load that resolves to none of the above - a register that's
// neither a stack slot, a known address, nor has a real base register
// at all - isn't lifted, but the destination register is still
// clobbered (see clobberReg): the real CPU DID overwrite it with

// (liftAdd/liftALU), stack-spilled parameters AND ordinary local
// variables (liftStr/liftLdr's stack-slot handling), and general
// (non-stack) memory access - struct field/array element dereferences
// through an arbitrary pointer (liftStr/liftLdr's FieldAccess
// handling). Remaining known gaps, none narrow enough yet to single
// out as "next":
//   - No real type system: every value is an untyped IR expression, so
//     a synthetic name like "field_8" or "local_16" is exactly that -
//     synthetic, not a recovered field/variable name, and there's no
//     way to tell an int from a pointer from a bool short of the
//     surrounding operation's own shape.
//   - Register-indexed ("[Rn, Rm]") and pre/post-indexed
//     ("[Rn, #disp]!"/"[Rn], #disp") addressing aren't distinguished
//     from plain offset addressing at all (native.MemOperand doesn't
//     currently capture either) - real -O0 code mostly avoids both in
//     favor of explicit address arithmetic, but when they do appear,
//     a writeback's effect on the base register is silently unmodeled.
//   - No real per-iteration dataflow/fixpoint analysis for loop bodies
//     (see tryLiftWhileLoop's own doc comment) and no real merge-point
//     /dominance analysis for if/else reconvergence (see
//     liftBlockGraph's own doc comment) - both accepted, documented
//     trade-offs of this lifter's per-fork, no-shared-state model
//     rather than open gaps to close.
